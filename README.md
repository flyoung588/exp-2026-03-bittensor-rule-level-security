A 10-Day Public Experiment on Incentive Misalignment and First Principles in AI–Crypto Systems

exp-2026-03 · Rule-Level Security and Incentive Game Analysis of the Bittensor Protocol
Overview

This repository documents a 10-day public experiment analyzing the rule-level security of the Bittensor protocol.

Rather than focusing on code bugs or exploits, this experiment studies a deeper and more systemic question:

When incentives are defined entirely by protocol rules, can the system remain secure against rational, intelligent participants?

Bittensor serves as a real-world, high-stakes laboratory for understanding how AI + Crypto incentive systems behave under strategic pressure.

Objectives

This experiment aims to answer the following questions:

Are there structural incentive misalignments in Bittensor at the rule level?

Can rational participants extract disproportionate rewards legally by optimizing against the rules?

Are these phenomena specific to Bittensor, or universal to AI–Crypto systems?

This is not an attack guide.
This is a mechanism-level investigation.

Core Perspectives

All analysis is conducted through three alternating lenses:

System Designer Perspective
What behavior does the protocol intend to reward?

Rational Attacker Perspective
What behavior does the protocol actually reward?

First-Principles Perspective
Are these incentive failures fundamentally unavoidable?

⚠️ This repository does not include exploits, malicious code, or illegal activities.

“Vulnerabilities are not always bugs — sometimes they are the inevitable result of rules working exactly as intended.”
