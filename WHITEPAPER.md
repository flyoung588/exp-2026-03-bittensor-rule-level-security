# Designing Incentives Under Rational Intelligence

## A Rule-Level Security Framework for AI + Crypto Systems

### Abstract

AI + Crypto systems combine two forces that amplify each other: autonomous optimization and programmable incentives. While this convergence enables open, scalable coordination, it also creates environments where strategic behavior evolves faster than governance and intent.

This paper presents a rule-level security framework derived from **exp-2026-03**, a ten-day public experiment analyzing Bittensor as a live AI + Crypto incentive system. Rather than focusing on vulnerabilities or exploits, the experiment examined how rational agents adapt to incentive structures over time — and what this implies for system designers, participants, and governors.

The central conclusion is clear: **failure is not an exception in incentive-driven systems, but their default trajectory**. Robust systems are those designed to anticipate, bound, and manage misalignment rather than attempting to eliminate it.

## 1. Introduction: Why AI + Crypto Requires a New Security Lens

Traditional security models focus on:

* Bugs
* Attacks
* Unauthorized access

AI + Crypto systems fail differently.

They fail when:

* Incentives drift
* Metrics are optimized against their intent
* Rational agents converge on degenerate equilibria

These failures are often **rule-compliant**, economically rational, and socially invisible — until they become irreversible.

This paper argues that **rule-level security**, not code-level correctness, is the dominant risk surface in AI + Crypto systems.

## 2. From Bugs to Behaviors: Redefining the Threat Model

### 2.1 Code Can Be Correct, Systems Can Still Fail

Incentive systems can:

* Compile successfully
* Pass audits
* Follow documented rules

And still produce outcomes that undermine their purpose.

The root cause is not malicious actors, but **misaligned selection pressures**.

---

### 2.2 Rational Intelligence as an Adversary

Participants in AI + Crypto systems should be assumed to be:

* Rational
* Adaptive
* Reward-maximizing
* Capable of coordination

This includes humans, bots, and increasingly, AI agents.

Security models that assume goodwill do not scale.

## 3. Experimental Methodology (exp-2026-03)

The experiment analyzed Bittensor across ten dimensions:

1. Incentive geometry
2. Information asymmetry
3. Metric manipulability
4. Strategy convergence
5. Capital accumulation dynamics
6. Governance latency
7. Reward convexity
8. Entry and exit friction
9. Failure observability
10. System-level resilience

Each day isolated one layer, progressing from protocol rules to emergent behaviors.

## 4. Key Observations from the Experiment

### 4.1 Incentives Create Local Truths, Not Global Goals

Participants optimize for what is rewarded, not what is intended.

Metrics become targets.
Targets cease to measure value.

---

### 4.2 Dominance Emerges Before Governance Reacts

When rewards are convex:

* Early advantages compound
* Rank persistence increases
* Contestability decreases

By the time governance responds, the system is often already captured.

---

### 4.3 Exploitation Is Often Invisible

The most damaging strategies:

* Follow all explicit rules
* Do not trigger alerts
* Appear “efficient”

Silent failure is more dangerous than visible attacks.

---

## 5. A Rule-Level Security Framework

### 5.1 Managed Misalignment

Perfect alignment is unattainable.

Security should aim for:

* Bounded damage
* Detectable drift
* Recoverable states

---

### 5.2 Localizing Failure

Systems should prefer:

* Modular incentives
* Isolated failure domains
* Limited blast radius

Monolithic reward structures amplify systemic risk.

---

### 5.3 Flattening Reward Convexity

Highly convex rewards:

* Incentivize domination
* Reduce diversity
* Accelerate stagnation

Flattened rewards trade short-term efficiency for long-term adaptability.

---

### 5.4 Designing for Turnover

Healthy systems exhibit:

* Rank volatility
* Strategy churn
* Periodic displacement

Stability is not health; it is often decay.

---

### 5.5 Governance as Damage Control

Governance cannot engineer alignment.

Its realistic role is:

* Slowing degradation
* Resetting extreme states
* Maintaining contestability

Minimal, fast, reversible actions outperform complex reforms.

---

## 6. Operational Signals and Early Warnings

Designers should monitor:

* Reward concentration curves
* Rank persistence metrics
* Behavioral diversity indices
* Entry success rates

These signals reveal systemic health earlier than social sentiment or governance debate.

---

## 7. Designing for Graceful Degradation

Robust systems:

* Fail gradually
* Signal stress early
* Avoid cliff-edge collapses

Catastrophic failure is a design flaw, not an inevitability.

---

## 8. Implications Beyond Bittensor

The framework applies to:

* AI marketplaces
* Restaking protocols
* Data DAOs
* Autonomous agent economies

Any system combining optimization with incentives inherits these dynamics.

---

## 9. Conclusion: Designing for Reality, Not Ideals

AI + Crypto systems are evolutionary environments.

Designers do not control outcomes — they shape selection pressures.

The most dangerous systems are not those that fail, but those that **fail silently**.

Designing with failure in mind is not pessimism.
It is the only viable path to long-term resilience under rational intelligence.
